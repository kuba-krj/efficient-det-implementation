# EfficientDet for Edge-Aware Image Segmentation

In this task the aim was to implement one of the state-of-the-art NN architectures for dense predictions - [EfficientDet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf). This architecture consists of pretrained EfficientNet backbone, Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) with pixel-wise weights and two heads - one for person segmentation (single class) and the other for edge detection. This network was trained on the PennFundan dataset with traditional augmentations. Details of the task (implementation and short report summing up the results) can be found in the notebook.
